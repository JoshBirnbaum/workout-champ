This is the first web app I made by myself, using html, css, and javascript files.
The App uses the java script Date function to update the Day in real time and the main purpose of the app is to store workouts for each day of the week.
Using local storage you can edit the workout you want to do on each day adding or deleting exercises, and on that day your workout type and exercises will be displayed.
The code is not very clean but it is a simple and small app.
