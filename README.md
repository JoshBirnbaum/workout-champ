# workout-champ
This is the first web app I made by myself, using html, css, and javascript files.
The App uses the java script Date function to update the Day in real time and the main purpose of the app is to store workouts for each day of the week.
Using local storage you can edit the workout you want to do on each day adding or deleting exercises, and on that day your workout type and exercises will be displayed.
The code is not very clean but it is a simple and small app.

Things I have taken away from creating this app:
1. It is important to plan out your app and everything you want it to do, so that decision making while designing and writing the code is easier.
2. When writing the javascript to section it out in small pieces that can be done in sections, this helped me continue working on the app over the course of a few days. However it is also important to have code reviews after each section, so that you do not have a lot of messy code while trying to do further sections or at the end of the project.
3. Practice practice practice
